## Project Description

### Objective

The primary goal of **WebServer 42** is to create a functional and scalable web server that can handle HTTP requests, serve web pages, and support various web technologies. This project is a valuable opportunity to learn about networking, server-side programming, and web development.

### Key Features

- **HTTP Protocol**: Implement the HTTP/1.1 protocol to handle client requests and responses.
- **Multiplexing**: Utilize multiplexing to handle multiple client connections simultaneously.
- **Request Routing**: Create a routing system to map URLs to server-side code and serve dynamic content.
- **Static File Serving**: Serve static HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and other web assets.
- **CGI Support**: Support Common Gateway Interface (CGI) for executing server-side scripts.
- **Virtual Hosts**: Implement virtual hosting to host multiple websites on a single server.
- **Security Measures**: Apply security best practices to protect against common web vulnerabilities.
- **Logging**: Generate access and error logs to monitor server activity.
- **Configuration File**: Create a configuration file for easy server setup and customization.

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Language**: C++
- **Socket Programming**: POSIX Sockets
- **Multiplexing**: Utilize multiplexing to handle multiple client connections simultaneously (select()).

## conclusion

webserv is a project that is very interesting to do, it allows you to understand how a web server works and how to create one from scratch. It is a project that requires a lot of research and reading of documentation, but it is very rewarding to see the result of your work.
