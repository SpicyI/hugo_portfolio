## Cub3D
**Cub3D** is an exciting and innovative project that combines gaming and programming. This project takes inspiration from the classic 3D maze games and challenges you to build your own maze engine using C and raycasting techniques.

## Objective

The primary objective of the **Cub3D** project is to create a simple 3D maze game where the player navigates through a labyrinth using raycasting to render the environment.

## Key Features

- **Raycasting Engine**: Implement a raycasting engine to render the 3D maze environment in a 2D window.
- **Maze Generation**: Generate random mazes or create custom-designed levels for the player to explore.
- **Player Controls**: Implement intuitive player controls for movement and interaction within the maze.
- **Textures**: Add textures and colors to the walls and floor to enhance the visual experience.
- **Sprites**: Incorporate sprite rendering for interactive objects or enemies within the maze.
- **Minimap**: Create a minimap to provide an overview of the entire maze layout.
- **HUD**: Design a heads-up display (HUD) to display important game information.
- **Interactive Elements**: Add doors, keys, and other interactive elements to increase gameplay complexity.
- **Winning Condition**: Define a winning condition for the player to complete the maze or achieve a specific goal.

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Language**: C
- **Graphics Library**: [MiniLibX](https://harm-smits.github.io/42docs/libs/minilibx/introduction.html)
- **Development Environment**: Unix/Linux

- ## Getting Started

To get started with **Cub3D**, follow these steps:

clone the repository:
```git clone https://github.com/SpicyI/Cub-3D.git```

Build the game:
````make````

run the game:
```./cub3d /path/to/map.cub ```
